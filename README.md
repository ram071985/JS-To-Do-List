This to do list is a fast and conveinant way to keep track of your day to day tasks.  You can cross items off when you have completed them and delete each item seperately.  For a live running version go to my GitHub Page  - [HERE](https://ram071985.github.io/to-do-list/)

## Summary

Building and designing this to do list was challenging in many ways!  I learned how to use events more effectively, worked more with lexical scope, built a stronger sense of logic and became much more comfortable working with varibles and manipulating the DOM by creating a new unordered list by using the createElement and appendChild methods.  

## Features

- cross off each finished task
- delete each task seperately to shorten your list
